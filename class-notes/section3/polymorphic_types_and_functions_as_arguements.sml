(*

- Higher-order functinos are often so "generic" and "reusable" that they have polymorphic types, ie, types with type variables
- But there are higher-order functions that are not polymorphic
- And there are non-higher-order (first-order) functions that are polymorphic
- Always a good idea to understand the type of a function, especially a higher-order function
