(* functional programming can mean a few different things:

- avoiding mutation
- using functions as values

also:
- recursion
- style closer to mathematical definitions
- programming idioms using laziness
- anything not OOP or C (not a good definition)
*)

(* FIRST-CLASS FUNCTIONS:
- use them whereever we use values
- functions are values too
- most common use is an argument/result of another function
  - other function is called a 'higher-order function'
  - powerful way to factor out common functionality

FUNCTION CLOSURE:
- function that uses bindings from outside the function definition



- these are separate concepts (though often not muddled)
