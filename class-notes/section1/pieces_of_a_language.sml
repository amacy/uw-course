(* Five different things:

1. syntax
2. semantics (type checking & evaluation rules)
3. idioms (recognizing typical patterns of use for language features)
4. libraries (what facilities are standard in a language)
5. tools (make your job easier (REPL, debugger, code formatter) - not provided by the language itself)
