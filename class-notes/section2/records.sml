(*
RECORDS - new 'each of' type
- contains field names and corresponding values
- order in records doens't (REPL alphabetizes them)
- #field_name record_name returns value
- find by name (as opposed to by position, as in tuples)
- functions in ML are actually a hybrid of finding by postion & name:
    - in the function call, variables are paramaterized by position
    - inside the function, they're found by name
