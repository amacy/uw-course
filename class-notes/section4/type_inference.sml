(* 
static type-checking can reject a program before it runs to prevent the 
possibility of some errors (statically typed languages). They check type at compile time.

dynamically typed lang languages do little or no such checking. They do type checking at run-time.

ML is also implicitly typed: rarely need to write down types

ML can infer types with type variables, but don't confuse these two concepts:
- PLs can have type inference without type variables
- PLs can have type variables without type inference
